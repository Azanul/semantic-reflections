assuming you already know what Django is and what is ORM. If not:-\nDjango is a high-level web framework for building web applications quickly and with less code. It is written in Python and follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. Django provides many built-in features such as a user authentication system, admin interface, and database abstraction layer, which makes it easier to develop web applications.\nAn important part of the database abstraction layer is ORM, which stands for Object-Relational Mapping. ORM is a feature of Django that allows you to interact with your database as if you were working with Python objects. Instead of writing raw SQL queries, you can use the Django ORM to perform database operations in a more intuitive and Pythonic way. The ORM provides a high-level API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records in your database. It also supports complex operations such as aggregations, relationships, and custom lookups, allowing you to write efficient and scalable database code for your Django projects.\nWe'll be using the official Django polls app example.\n\nNow let's jump into the cool stuff:\nCustom Lookups\nWe can define custom lookups to perform complex database queries. For example, we can create a custom lookup to search for questions that lie within a certain length range. You can define the lookup as:\n\nWe can query questions with length within the range [16, 40] by running:\n\nFor more info on custom lookups visit this link.\nAggregation &amp; Annotation\nDjango ORM provides built-in support for database-level aggregation operations, such as counting, summing, averaging, grouping and more. These operations can be performed using the django.db.models API. The aggregate and annotate methods allow for powerful data analysis and manipulation and can help you write cleaner, more efficient code. Let's see a few examples:\n\nI recommend that you take a look at the official documentation if you think you need either aggregation &amp; annotation as it's much more detailed there, here's the link. Feel free to comment below if you have any queries not covered there. We need to be careful about yielding wrong results while aggregating &amp; annotating, check out this link. In the last example we've used a subquery, let's look further into it.\nSubqueries\nSubqueries in Django ORM allow you to use the results of one query as input for another query. You can perform complex operations by chaining multiple queries together, which can lead to more efficient and readable code.\nSubqueries can be used in several ways in the Django ORM, including as a filter, as an annotation, or as an expression. To use a subquery as a filter, you can use the Subquery expression in the filter method. To use a subquery as an annotation, you can use the Subquery expression in the annotate method. To use a subquery as an expression, you can use it as an input to other expressions, such as F expressions (we'll look into these in the next part). Lets take an example, let's say you want to find all questions that have at least one choice with a vote count greater than 5. One way to achieve this would be to use the exclude method along with a subquery:\n\nreference link.\nModel Inheritance\nThis section can be an entire article all by itself and we still won't be able to cover it all. I hope you're already familiar with OOP. Django ORM supports several forms of model inheritance. The main forms are:\n\n\nAbstract Base Classes: An abstract base class is a model that is meant to be used as a base class for other models, but it won't be instantiated itself. It provides fields that can be reused by other models but it is not stored in the database. Let's update our Question and Choice models to have created_at and updated_at times. We'll do so by making both of them extend an abstract class BaseModel.\n\nBoth Question and Choice will have all their fields and those of BaseModel .\n\n\nMulti-table Inheritance: Multi-table inheritance allows a model to inherit fields and methods from multiple parent models. The fields and methods of the parent models are stored in separate tables in the database, with the child model having its table for its fields. Let's extend our example for this:\n\nCommunityChoice will have all fields from Choice as well as from CommunityModel .\n\n\nProxy models: Proxy models are models that inherit from an existing model, but don't add any fields or methods. They are typically used to change the manager for a model, or change the default ordering of the model's objects.\n\nIn this example, PublishedQuestion is a proxy model that extends the Question model. The PublishedQuestion model has a method was_published_recently that checks if the question was published on the last day. Because PublishedQuestion is a proxy model, it has the same fields and behavior as the Question model, but can have additional methods and attributes.\n\n\nLet me clear up any dangling confusion among these three. Abstract models do not create DB tables, neither do Proxy models. Proxy models inherit a solid (has a DB table) model class, Abstract models are inherited for adding extra fields.\nRaw SQL Query\nIf nothing else works for you, but you know SQL then you can run raw SQL queries directly to the connected database. We don't even have to create a new connection. We use the same persistent connection created by Django. Let's fetch all questions published before 1st Feb 2023.\n\nBut what if we wanted Question objects instead of raw query results. We can get it like this:\n\nWe can even fetch question data from a different table, all we need is to provide the mapping from the source fields to destination fields if fields are differently numbered or named. Let's take a separate table\n\nNow there are still two ways to do this:\n\nThis way we get the fields from NotQuestion in Question objects. The other way is to use the AS syntax in SQL.\n\nConclusion\nSoon enough I'll add the next part to it, in which we'll cover Relationships, Prefetch, F expressions, Transactions and Indexing &amp; Caching.

If you're familiar with Question and Choice models in Django's official documentation that'll work too.\nLet's continue\nRelationships\nRelationships can be complicated but they don't have to be. In Django, relationships between models are defined using fields such as ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, and OneToOneField. These fields establish connections between tables in the database, allowing for related data to be retrieved with a single query. Relationships can be defined in two ways: one-to-many, where one model instance is related to multiple instances of another model, or many-to-many, where many instances of one model are related to many instances of another model. We've been using ForeignKey to link Question to Choice . Let's make some changes\n\nOneToOneField &amp; ManyToManyField are both self-explanatory. One big upside of these relationships, besides ensuring proper classification of data, is that we can prefetch related data if we knew we're going to need it. Let's look into how we can do that.\nPrefetch\nPrefetching in Django ORM allows you to fetch related objects in bulk, reducing the number of database queries required to retrieve data. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex relationships or when you need to retrieve data from multiple related objects.\n\nThere are some dangers of prefetch that we need to be wary of. It adds overhead and increases memory consumption.\nF expressions\nDjango ORM's f expressions provide a way to perform database operations and calculate values on the fly without accessing the database multiple times. The f expression allows you to define custom computations within the query and avoids the need for manual calculations outside of the database.\nOne of the main advantages of using f expressions is that they can be used in queries, aggregations, and updates, providing a flexible and efficient way to perform complex database operations.\n\nIn this example, we first retrieve a specific question using the Question.objects.get method. Then, we filter the related Choice objects for that question and annotate each choice with a new field, percentage, which represents the percentage of votes that each choice has received. This percentage is calculated by dividing the number of votes for each choice (votes) by the total number of votes for all choices (question__choice__votes__sum). The F expression allows us to perform these calculations directly in the database and return the results as a queryset, rather than having to perform the calculations in Python code.\nTransactions\nA transaction is started automatically when the first database operation is executed. All database operations executed within a transaction are committed together or rolled back if an error occurs. By default, Django automatically starts a new transaction for every request-response cycle, ensuring that any database changes made during a request are not persisted if an error occurs.\nTo explicitly control transactions in your Django application, you can use the transaction.atomic decorator or context manager. Within a transaction block, you can execute any number of database operations, and either commit the transaction by returning normally or roll back the transaction by raising an exception.\nLet's try first with transaction.atomic decorator.\n\nNow using a context manager\n\nIndexing\nIn order to optimize database queries, we can add indexes to specific fields in our models. This is particularly useful for columns that are frequently used for filtering, sorting or grouping data. In Django, indexes can be created either through the database directly or through Django models. Let's look at an example, if we want to search questions by pub_date, we\n\nwe'll get in deeper into DB indexing in a future article, for now, that's all you need.\nCaching\nDjango provides a cache framework that allows you to cache your entire site or specific parts of it. To use caching in Django, you need to add a cache backend to your settings file. For example, you can use memcached as a cache backend:\n\nThen, you can cache specific views or parts of your site using the cache decorator or the cache template tag. For example, to cache the result of a view for 60 * 15 seconds (15 minutes):\n\nDjango official documentation is quite good for this section, definitely check it out if you're looking in caching. Here's the link.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Django ORM offers a range of powerful tools to help you manage your database efficiently. From custom lookups, aggregations, and raw SQL queries to model inheritance, proxy models, relationships, and efficient caching techniques, the Django ORM provides a comprehensive and flexible framework for database management.\nBy mastering these advanced techniques, you can streamline your database operations, improve the performance of your applications, and take full advantage of the power and scalability of Django. Whether you are a seasoned Django developer or just getting started, I hope this article has given you valuable insights into the hidden magic of Django ORM and how to use it to its full potential.\nTo get notified for cool articles like this in the future, follow me on Twitter at AzanulZ or connect with me on LinkedIn, Azanul Haque.\n","id":"https://blog.azanulhaque.dev/django-orm-2/","title":"Django ORM's Hidden Magic: Advanced Uses and Techniques, Part-2"},"https://blog.azanulhaque.dev/python-concurreny/":{"body":"Concurrency refers to the ability of a program to manage multiple tasks seemingly at the same time. While a single CPU core can only execute one instruction at a time, concurrency allows programs to juggle multiple tasks by rapidly switching between them. This creates the illusion of parallelism, enhancing responsiveness and improving performance for I/O bound workloads.\nThere are two ways one can achieve concurrency in Python:\n\nMultithreading\nAsynchronous Programming (Asyncio)\n\nLet's explore them one by one. This time we’re running a restraunt, we're extending the example used in article. We're going to have 3 chefs this time.\n1. Multithreading\nThreads are lightweight units of execution within a single process. They share the same memory space and resources but execute instructions independently.\nMultiple threads can be running concurrently, but due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python's traditional CPython implementation, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. There are other Python implementations that one can choose from, depending on the use case.\n\n\nLet's redefine ordered_dishes to also print a message when an order is made.\n\n\n\nLet's define a function prepare_dish wrapping our food pipeline logic.\n\n\n\nLet's create a thread pool with 3 workers and map prepare_dish with the dishes being ordered.\n\n\n\nFull script\n\n\n\n2. Asynchronous Programming (Asyncio)\nAsynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows for non-blocking operations. Instead of waiting for a task to complete before moving on to the next one, asynchronous programming enables tasks to run in the background, freeing up resources and potentially improving performance.\nPython's asyncio module provides a way to write concurrent code using the async and await syntax. It is particularly useful for I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.\n\n\nLet's make prepare_dish an asynchronous function by prefixing the definition with async keyword.\n\n\n\nLet's create a pool with 3 workers and call prepare_dish with the dishes being ordered, similar to what we did with threads. To attain this, we're going to use a Semaphore. async and await can only be used inside an async function.\n\n\n\nWrap it all in an async main function and run it with asyncio.run. We use asyncio.create_task to run tasks concurrently. asyncio.gather aggregates the results of every coroutine passed to it.\n\n\n\nFull script\n\n\n\nPros &amp; Cons\nFeatureAsyncioMultithreading (CPython)\nConcurrency ModelSingle-threaded, event loop drivenMulti-threaded\nCPU-bound tasksNot ideal (overhead for context switching)Limited benefit due to GIL (serializes execution)\nI/O-bound tasksWell-suited (handles waiting efficiently)Less efficient (overhead for thread management)\nMemory UsageLower (fewer threads)Higher (more threads)\nComplexitySimpler (fewer potential race conditions)More complex (requires synchronization)\nError HandlingEasier to reason about errorsError handling can be trickier (race conditions)\nLearning CurveSteeper (different programming paradigm)Easier to learn (familiar thread concepts)\n\nMoving forward\nIf you're not using CPython (e.g., Jython, IronPython), multithreading can potentially utilize multiple cores for CPU-bound tasks more effectively, depending on the implementation.\nFor highly CPU-bound tasks in CPython, consider libraries like multiprocessing which can leverage multiple cores by spawning separate processes instead of threads (processes don't share the GIL). We'll look deeper into multiprocessing in a different post.\nTill then here are a few good resources to go through:\n\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html\n\n","id":"https://blog.azanulhaque.dev/python-concurreny/","title":"Cooking concurrently in Python"},"https://blog.azanulhaque.dev/python-context-managers/":{"body":"The with statement in Python is primarily used for resource management. It ensures that a resource is properly initialized and released when it's no longer needed, even if exceptions occur during the execution. It can also be used for suppressing certain exceptions or outputs.\nBasically, context-managers can be leveraged to create a temporary state change and revert it to original once the intended work is done.\nA few common use cases for context-managers are:\n\nFile I/O Operations: ensuring that file is properly closed after use.\nNetwork Connections: ensuring the connection is properly closed after use.\nTransaction Management: managing transactions - beggining, commiting, aborting, etc.\nResource Management: automatically releasing the lock, freeing the resource after use.\n\nLet's take an example to explore context-managers further. Let's say that we have a function which prints a message to standard output. We want to capture this output instead of releasing it to standard output.\nImagine you're a super spy with a secret message, but you don't want anyone to see it! That's where our special code comes in. It's like a magic box that hides messages until you open it again.\n\n\nWe need a secret message to hide. To do this we simply define a function which will print a string.\n\n\n\nLet's create our message box. Our message box is going to be a context manager, so it has to implement the necessary enter() and exit() methods. enter() is called at the start of the context and exit() is called at the end, duh! enter() will return an object which can be accessed with as keyword. exit() is called with 3 arguments: exception type, exception value and traceback, these values are going to be None is no exception occured in the context. In enter() method, we're storing the stdout in an instance valiable _original and setting the stdout to a StringIO() object. In exit() method, we're resetting the stdout and storing the captured output in _original.\n\n\n\nNow, let's use our box to hide a message. We're using with statement wo invoke our context manager and as to capture the object returned by enter() method of the context manager SecretMessageBox into a variable secret_box.\n\n\n\nOnce we've hidden the message, we want to read the message later\n\n\n\nPutting it all together\n\n\n\nIn case we face an exception but want to ignore certain exception or certain type of exceptions. We define a RuntimeError, raise it from secret_message() function and handle it in exit() method. True returned from exit() implies the exception raised has been handled else the exception is raised further down the sttack.\n\n\n\nFinal script\n\n\n\nAlso checkout contextlib, it provides some common utilities involving the with statement.\n","id":"https://blog.azanulhaque.dev/python-context-managers/","title":"Python context managers"},"https://blog.azanulhaque.dev/python-generators/":{"body":"Generators are a powerful concept in Python that offer memory-efficient ways to create iterators. Unlike traditional iterables like lists or tuples that store all values in memory at once, generators produce values on demand, making them ideal for handling large datasets, data processing pipelines or infinite sequences.\nLet's take an example to dive into generators. Imagine that you're a chef and you don't want to prepare the ingredients beforehand as you don't know how many and which dishes are going to sell today. We're going to create a pipeline from ordering random dishes to preparing and serving them.\n\n\nDefine a menu and the ingredients required for each dish first.\n\n\n\nLet's say we get between 1 to a hundered customers each day and each of them orders a random dish from the menu. We'll store it in a list ordered_dishes.\n\n\n\nWe get a maximum of 100 customers per day so it's fine to store all the dishes in a list but what if we were to get a million customers per day. We don't want to have to store so much data in-memory till we process each dish. To fix it let's convert this to a generator expression to process one ordered dish at a time.\n\n\n\nTo present the final dish, we need to first get the ingredients, cook them and serve the dish. All these functions don't really need to be generators but how else are we going to learn about generators.\n\n\n\nNow creating the pipeline and capturing the output.\n\n\n\nFinal script\n\n\n\nThis is very practical for a one man operation but what if it were a restraunt, multiple waiters, mutiple chefs, serving multiple. In that case we'll have to dive into concurrency, that's a story for another day.

Multiprocessing\nMultiprocessing is a parallel processing technique that uses multiple processes to execute tasks. Each process has its own memory space, allowing true parallel execution of tasks on multiple CPU cores.\nWe avoid having to worry about the GIL since we're using subprocesses (which have their own memory space) instead of threads (which share a memory space and GIL keeps multiple threads from accessing the same memory at the same time).\n\n\nLet's create a Pool with 3 processes and map the ordered dishes with our prepare_dish function.\n\n\n\nFull script\n\n\n\n2. Parallel processing libraries\nPython offers various libraries like Joblib, Dask and Ray that simplify parallelism and can handle tasks across multiple cores efficiently (even multiple different machines with Dask &amp; Ray).\nI'm sure you can find more tools and libraries which aim to attain the same with their own pros and cons. We're going to check out how these three work and how to use them.\nIn this article we'll only checkout Joblib and cover Dask &amp; Ray in a future article where we'd prepare ingredients in a different restraunt and cook them in a different restraunt.\n\n\nThe function Parallel here is pretty self explainatory.

For CPU-bound tasks, both methods offer good performance. However, for I/O-bound tasks, parallel processing libraries may provide a more efficient solution due to lower overhead.\nRemember to always test and benchmark your code to determine which method and which specific library best suits your specific requirements.\nIf you're dealing with big data loads or anything that requires high computational capacity then single machine parallelism is not going to solve your issue.
